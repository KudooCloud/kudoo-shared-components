The `React` components are separated by our classification
* bosons
* nuclei
* atoms
* screens

Bosons are the smallest UI components we have and make up the base components of everything we do. Bosons are the lowest common denominator

Nuclei consist of a bunch of commonly used components that together form a piece of common functionality

Atoms are the building blocks of the application. They can be thought of as the Lego blocks that make up the application. The Atoms are:
* Drawer
* Footer
* HeaderBar
* NotFound
* Tabs
* Screens
